## Hi there, I'm Cynthia ğŸ‘‹,
A wife, mother, sibling, friend, & data enthusiast.  
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on landing my entry-level data job
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and model creation projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help getting some hands-on experience in data science as a recent MSc. Data science graduate 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: whenever I learn something interesting and beneficial new, I start thinking about how I can pass it on to others, though I don't necessarily do it right away!
