## Hi there, I'm Cynthia ðŸ‘‹,
A wife, mother, sibling, friend, & data enthusiast.  
- I enjoy working using Salesforce as a CRM/data tool
- I have extensive work experience in Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning working with data in international Non/For-Profit Organizations
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and model creation projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: whenever I learn something interesting and beneficial new, I start thinking about how I can pass it on to others, though I don't necessarily do it right away!
